All the features provided have predictable\nabstractions and join together coherently.\n\n```js\n// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.\nconst prism = require('prism-media');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));\n```\n\nThe example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing\nyour code for whichever you install.\n\n- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) \n- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)\n- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)\n- Volume Altering (no modules required!)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following dependencies are all optional, and you should only install one from each category (the first listed in\neach category is preferred)\n\n- Opus\n  - [`@discordjs/opus`](https://github.com/discordjs/opus)\n  - [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus)\n  - [`opusscript`](https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript)\n- FFmpeg\n  - [`ffmpeg-static`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-static)\n  - `ffmpeg` from a [normal installation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n\n## Useful Links\n\n- [Documentation](https://amishshah.github.io/prism-media)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/amishshah/prism-media/tree/master/examples)\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)\n\n## License\n\n> Copyright 2019 - 2022 Amish Shah\n> \n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n> you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n> You may obtain a copy of the License at\n> \n>    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n> \n> Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n> distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n> See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n> limitations under the License.",
