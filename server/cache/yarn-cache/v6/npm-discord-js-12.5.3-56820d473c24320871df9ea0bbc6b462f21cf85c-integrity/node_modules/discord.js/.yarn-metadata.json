When both are available, discord.js will automatically choose @discordjs/opus.\nUsing opusscript is only recommended for development environments where @discordjs/opus is tough to get working.\nFor production bots, using @discordjs/opus should be considered a necessity, especially if they're going to be running on multiple servers.\n\n### Optional packages\n\n- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)\n- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)\n- One of the following packages can be installed for faster voice packet encryption and decryption:\n  - [sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (`npm install sodium`)\n  - [libsodium.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) (`npm install libsodium-wrappers`)\n- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)\n- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)\n\n## Example usage\n\n```js\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Discord.Client();\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('message', msg => {\n  if (msg.content === 'ping') {\n    msg.reply('pong');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('token');\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Website](https://discord.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/website))\n- [Documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/general/welcome)\n- [Guide](https://discordjs.guide/) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/guide)) - this is still for stable  \n  See also the [Update Guide](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/changes-in-v12.html), including updated and removed items in the library.\n- [Discord.js Discord server](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9)\n- [Discord API Discord server](https://discord.gg/discord-api)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)\n- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)\n- [Related libraries](https://discordapi.com/unofficial/libs.html)\n\n### Extensions\n\n- [RPC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/RPC))\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore creating an issue, please ensure that it hasn't already been reported/suggested, and double-check the\n[documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs).  \nSee [the contribution guide](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to submit a PR.\n\n## Help\n\nIf you don't understand something in the documentation, you are experiencing problems, or you just need a gentle\nnudge in the right direction, please don't hesitate to join our official [Discord.js Server](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9).\n",
